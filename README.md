# coverLetterGenerator

Generates a unique new cover letter using the openAI api.

## Files needed

Requires three docs an existing cover letter, resume and job specification

./localFiles/existingCoverLetter.txt'
'./localFiles/resume.pdf'
'./localFiles/jobspec.txt'

These files are included in the gitignore so as not to leak these to the repo.

## FrontEnd Masters

This project was inspired by the openAI course on Front End Masters. Great course would recommend!
